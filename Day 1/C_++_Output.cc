#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "hellow world";

    //To Print Many Outputs
    cout << "hello Line 1";
    cout << "hello line 2";
    cout << "hello line 3";
    cout << "hello line 4";

    //To Print NewLine in C++
    //To insert a new line in your output, you can use the \n character:

    cout << "hello world \n";

    // You can also use another << operator and place the \n character after the text, like this:
      cout << "Hello World!" << "\n";
  cout << "Hello Here I am learning C++";

  // Tip: Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line:
   cout << "Hello World!" << "\n\n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";

  // Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator:
   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  cout << "I am learning C++";

  //Note:
  // Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.
